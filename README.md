# Minishell
A recreation of Bash in C. Features command execution, custom parser, pipes, redirections, heredocs, environment variable handling, built-in commands (cd, echo, export, etc.), and full signal management (e.g., Ctrl+C). Built as a team project with focus on performance, modularity, memory safety, and clean architecture.
